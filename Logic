import libraries

set defaults to be used throughout the script

user to input length, width, N which is the total number of circled inscribed in the rectangle, radius as radi, central_lat, central_long, x
calculate the area, area of circle, radius, diameter, hyp, heigh from user input

number of iterations for x axis
    create seq function with parameters start, iteration and step
    iterate through to create a list
    return list

number of iterations for y axis
    create seq function with parameters start, iteration and step
    iterate through to create a list
    return list

add central long to each coordinate of x axis
    loop through results of seq for x axis
    return appended list from loop

add central_lat to each coordinate of y axis
    loop through results of seq for y axis
    return appended list from loop
