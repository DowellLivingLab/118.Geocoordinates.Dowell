import libraries

set defaults to be used throughout the script

user to input length, width, N which is the total number of circled inscribed in the rectangle, radius as radi, central_lat, central_long, x
calculate the area, area of circle, radius, diameter, hyp, heigh from user input

number of iterations for x axis
    create seq function with parameters start, iteration and step
    iterate through to create a list
    return list

number of iterations for y axis
    create seq function with parameters start, iteration and step
    iterate through to create a list
    return list

add central_long to each coordinate of x axis
    loop through results of seq for x axis
    return appended list from loop

add central_lat to each coordinate of y axis
    loop through results of seq for y axis
    return appended list from loop

dataframe
    create dataframe with columns as appended list from loop (central_long) and index as appended list from loop (central_lat)
    replace null values with empty string
    perform value placing
    get the odd and even indexing values for both longitude and latitude
    value place the odd and even columns for both longitude and latitude
    convert a copy of the dataframe to an array
    store the array elements in a list where the results from seq of x axis is not empty
